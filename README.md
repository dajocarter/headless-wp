# Headless WP

The same thing you get when you download WP, just accompanied by five great plugins.

## What's Included?

WordPress now comes with a REST API exposed which allows us to detach the back-end and use modern front-end frameworks like React and Vue. Included is Custom Post Type UI for easy backend development. Advanced Custom Fields aids in backend development and keeps content editing clean and succinct. ACF to REST API exposes the data for the custom fields in the appropriate endpoints. WP API Menus creates endpoints for the menus, something the WP API does not do. It's also open source and easily editable to add more information if you need it. I also included FakerPress to create dummy data for development. Feel free to delete it if you don't need that.
